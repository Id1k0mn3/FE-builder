# Builder

Hi, its my builder for FE dev. this is the first version of my builder. For this i have used gulp and webpack(only for js and modules) 

So, following functions are added:
  1. SASS - with compiling from sass to css, i added 2 versions of style.css. 
    The first version contains tabs, spaces and etc(in order to check styles)
    The second version has the style.min.css

  2. Nunjucks - template engine for using cycles and for breaking apart and for other functions
  
  3. Added tasks for images. Those are contraction for images and optimization, add webp type
  
  4. Local server
  
  5. Modules for JS with webpack
  
  6. Compiling fonts from ttf to woff2. Add a function after inserting fonts to folder fonts and you'll receive a sass file with styles for your font.
